# BLuxA Corp Backend - Fixed Issues

## Issues Fixed

### 1. DNS Resolution Error (`[Errno -2] Name or service not known`)

**Problem**: The backend was trying to send notifications to an invalid webhook URL, causing DNS resolution failures.

**Solution**:
- Added proper error handling in `send_notification()` function
- Implemented graceful fallback when webhook URL is not configured
- Added timeout and proper exception handling for HTTP requests
- Created a retry mechanism with exponential backoff

### 2. Flask-Limiter Production Warning

**Problem**: Flask-Limiter was using in-memory storage, which is not recommended for production.

**Solution**:
- Added Flask-Limiter dependency to `requirements.txt`
- Configured Redis storage with fallback to in-memory storage
- Added proper rate limiting to all endpoints:
  - `/bookings`: 10 requests per minute
  - `/payments/create-intent`: 5 requests per minute
  - `/payments/confirm`: 5 requests per minute

### 3. POST /bookings 400 Error

**Problem**: The booking endpoint was returning 400 errors due to insufficient validation.

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive input validation
- Check for required fields: `pickup_location`, `dropoff_location`, `pickup_datetime`
- Improved error messages for better debugging
- Added proper JSON content-type validation
- Enhanced logging for better error tracking

### 4. Missing Dependencies

**Problem**: Required packages were missing from requirements.txt.

**Solution**:
- Added `Flask-Limiter==3.5.0` for rate limiting
- Added `requests==2.31.0` for HTTP requests
- Updated environment configuration

## New Features Added

### 1. Notification System
- Automatic notification sending for new bookings
- Retry mechanism for failed notifications
- Background thread for retry processing
- Proper error logging and monitoring

### 2. Enhanced Logging
- Structured logging with proper levels
- Error tracking for debugging
- Request/response logging
- Performance monitoring

### 3. Rate Limiting
- Protection against abuse
- Configurable limits per endpoint
- Redis storage for distributed environments
- Graceful fallback to in-memory storage

## Environment Variables

Update your `.env` file with:

```bash
# Optional: WhatsApp webhook for notifications
WHATSAPP_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-webhook-url.com

# Required: Stripe configuration
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_stripe_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret

# Optional: Redis for rate limiting (falls back to memory)
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify all fixes:

```bash
cd bluxa-backend
python test_backend.py
```

## Deployment Notes

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Environment Setup**:
   - Copy `env.example` to `.env`
   - Configure your environment variables
   - Set `WHATSAPP_WEBHOOK_URL` to a valid URL or leave empty to disable notifications

3. **Redis (Optional)**:
   - For production, configure Redis for rate limiting
   - If Redis is not available, the app will use in-memory storage

4. **Monitoring**:
   - Check logs for notification retry status
   - Monitor rate limiting effectiveness
   - Watch for DNS resolution errors

## API Endpoints

### Health Check
```
GET /health
```

### Pricing
```
GET /pricing
```

### Create Booking
```
POST /bookings
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "pickup_location": "123 Main St, New York, NY",
  "dropoff_location": "456 Broadway, New York, NY", 
  "pickup_datetime": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  "vehicle_type": "executive_sedan",
  "passenger_count": 2,
  "special_requests": "Wheelchair accessible"
}
```

### Payment Intent
```
POST /payments/create-intent
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "booking_id": "booking-uuid-here"
}
```

## Error Handling

The backend now provides detailed error messages:

- **400 Bad Request**: Missing required fields or invalid data
- **429 Too Many Requests**: Rate limit exceeded
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Server-side issues with proper logging

All errors are logged with timestamps and context for easier debugging.
